*********************************************************

This document contains ideas that I might or might not 
include in future releases.

- Make it possible to record a custom area of the screen
- Add so you can record the audiooutput (the sound from the desktop)
- Make it possible to add "macroes" to the basename, like date and time

..::Done::..
- Make it possible to see a preview within the program
- Add icons to the menues
