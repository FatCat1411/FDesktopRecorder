###Note to packagers
Currently CMake and QMake are equally supported. Although I might move towards only using CMake in the future. So if you haven't packaged the FDesktopRecorder before, use
CMake to build the program.

Please also read the "KNotifications" section below.
  
###Requires to build 
(NOTE: these are openSUSE 12.1 package names)
  ```
desktop-file-utils, libqt4-devel, gcc-c++, make, gcc46, libkde4-devel
  ```
###KNotifications
#### QMake 
Please note, that for Knotfications to work the "FDesktopRecorder.notifyrc" file must be placed in "/usr/share/kde4/apps/FDesktopRecorder". If Folder does not exists then create it.
This is currently beeing done for openSUSE by the RPM-file.

This way of installing the *.notifyrc file might change in the future.. :-)

#### CMake 
If you are using CMake to build this project, you can just do "# make install" after the "CMake-steps" below. 
This will install the *.notifyrc file in the correct place. If you are building an package (.rpm,.deb etc), please also read the "QMake" section above.
