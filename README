desktop-file-utils, libqt4-devel, gcc-c++, make, gcc46, libkde4-devel

..::KNotifications::..
Please note, that for Knotfications to work the "FDesktopRecorder.notifyrc" file must be placed in "/usr/share/kde4/apps/FDesktopRecorder". If Folder does not exists then create it.
This is currently beeing done for openSUSE by the RPM-file.

This way of installing the *.notifyrc file might change in the future.. :-)

OBS: If you are using CMake then you can just type "make install" and it will take care of these steps :-)

* make

..::How to build/compile via CMake (EXPERIMENTAL)::..
